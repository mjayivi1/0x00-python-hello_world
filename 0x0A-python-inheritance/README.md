# Project Title

## Description

This project consists of Python scripts that cover various concepts related to inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP). The tasks involve creating classes, implementing inheritance, and using class methods to perform specific actions.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Lookup

Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### Task 1: My List

Write a class `MyList` that inherits from `list` and includes a `print_sorted` method to print the list in ascending order.

### Task 2: Exact Same Class

Write a function that returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### Task 3: Same Class or Inherit From

Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### Task 4: Only Subclass Of

Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### Task 5: Geometry Module

Write an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

### Task 6: Improve Geometry

Improve the `BaseGeometry` class by adding a `area` method that raises an `Exception` with the message `area() is not implemented`.

### Task 7: Integer Validator

Enhance the `BaseGeometry` class by adding an `integer_validator` method that validates integer values.

### Task 8: Rectangle

Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and includes instantiation with width and height.

### Task 9: Full Rectangle

Extend the `Rectangle` class to implement the `area` method and provide a string representation of the rectangle.

### Task 10: Square #1

Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and includes instantiation with size.

### Task 11: Square #2

Extend the `Square` class to provide a customized string representation.
