# Project: Python Exceptions

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing exception handling in Python. It consists of several tasks that cover topics such as safe list printing, safe printing of integers, printing and counting integers, division with debugging, list division, and raising exceptions.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the difference between errors and exceptions.
- Understand when and how to use exceptions in Python.
- Handle exceptions correctly in your code.
- Raise built-in exceptions when necessary.
- Implement clean-up actions after exceptions.

## Project Structure
- **0-safe_print_list.py**: Function to safely print elements of a list.
- **1-safe_print_integer.py**: Function to safely print an integer.
- **2-safe_print_list_integers.py**: Function to safely print the first x integers of a list.
- **3-safe_print_division.py**: Function to safely divide two integers and print the result.
- **4-list_division.py**: Function to divide element by element between two lists.
- **5-raise_exception.py**: Function to raise a type exception.
- **6-raise_exception_msg.py**: Function to raise a name exception with a message.

## Requirements
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc

## How to Run
You can execute each task individually by running the corresponding main file. For example:
```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# ... and so on
